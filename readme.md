# Summary
Two small console applications to help solve some issues with certificates on windows machines

# WinCertificates.Catalog
Takes one input argument the name of the created csv file. This will go thru all certificates
that are accessible by the current user and save information into given csv file.

# WinCertificates.Finder
This takes a certificate thumbprint as input and tries to find certificates matching it
and will list the found matches in console/csv format.
